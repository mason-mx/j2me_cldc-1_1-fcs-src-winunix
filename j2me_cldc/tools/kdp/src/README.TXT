KDWP DEBUG PROXY (DEBUG AGENT) TOOL

The directory contains the source code of the
KDWP Debug Proxy (also known as Debug Agent)
implementation.

Debug Proxy is a tool that can be interposed between
a Java development environment (such as Forte) and 
the KVM. The Debug Proxy allows many of the memory-
consuming components of a JPDA (Java Platform Debug 
Architecture) compliant debugger to be processed on 
the development workstation, thereby reducing the
memory overhead that the debugging interfaces have
on the KVM and its target devices.

For further information on the Debug Proxy, refer
to the KWDP Specification and KVM Porting Guide.
