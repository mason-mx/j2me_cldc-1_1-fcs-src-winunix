VMEXTRA DIRECTORY

This directory contains the source code of
various platform-independent, optional
components of the KVM that are potentially
useful for many KVM ports.

- JAR file reader and inflater (decompressor)

- Java-level debugging interface (the parts
  of the debugger that need to reside inside
  KVM when using the KDWP debugging interface.)

- Implementation of a number of floating point
  functions required by CLDC Specification,
  version 1.1.
